Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm an incoming PhD student in the Michtom School of Computer Science at [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu/), working with [Prof. Subhadeep Sarkar](https://subhadeep.net/). My research revolves around optimizing data systems and distributed systems, with a specific focus on Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees. In this domain, I explore innovative compaction strategies and improvements to range deletes.

Before joining Brandeis, I earned my Master's in Computer Science with a specialization in Data-Centric Computing from the Graduate School of Arts & Science at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/). In my professional journey, I've accumulated hands-on experience with roles at diverse entities, including gaming startups like [kwalee](https://www.kwalee.com/) and industry giants such as [FIS](https://www.fisglobal.com/en) and [Wipro Limited](https://www.wipro.com/). My focus in these roles has been on financial services and cybersecurity domains.
