Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a PhD student at the Michtom School of Computer Science, [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu/), working under the mentorship of [Prof. Subhadeep Sarkar](https://subhadeep.net/). My research revolves around optimizing data systems and distributed systems, with a specific focus on Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees. In this domain, I explore innovative compaction strategies and improvements to range deletes.

Before my doctoral studies, I completed a Masterâ€™s degree in  Computer Science, specializing in Data-Centric Computing, at the  Graduate School of Arts & Science, [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/). This program helped solidify my foundation in the critical aspects of data systems which now informs my current research focus.

Professionally, I have been involved in various capacities across the tech industry, from innovative gaming startups like [Kwalee](https://www.kwalee.com/) to major corporations such as [FIS](https://www.fisglobal.com/en) and [Wipro Limited](https://www.wipro.com/). My roles have predominantly centered around data systems and distributed systems, where I developed skills that are integral to both my research and industry applications.

I am passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical, real-world technology solutions. I look forward to collaborating with fellow researchers and industry professionals who share a commitment to advancing our understanding and capabilities within computer science.
