Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a PhD student at the Michtom School of Computer Science, [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu/), working under the mentorship of [Prof. Subhadeep Sarkar](https://subhadeep.net/). My research revolves around optimizing data systems and distributed systems, with a current focus on Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees. In this domain, I explore innovative compaction strategies and improvements to range deletes. I completed a Masterâ€™s degree in  Computer Science, specializing in Data-Centric Computing, at the  Graduate School of Arts & Science, [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/).

Professionally, I have been involved in various capacities across the tech industry, from innovative gaming startups like [Kwalee](https://www.kwalee.com/) to major corporations such as [FIS Global](https://www.fisglobal.com/en) and [Wipro Limited](https://www.wipro.com/). My roles have predominantly centered around data systems and distributed systems, where I developed skills that are integral to both my research and industry applications.
