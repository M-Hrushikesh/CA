I’m Hrushikesh , a small-town boy from Khammam, India, with a big passion for finance, business transformation, and problem-solving. As a Chartered Accountant (equivalent to CPA) and a Master’s in Finance candidate at Brandeis University, I’ve learned that finance isn’t just about numbers—it’s about creating real impact.

At Deloitte, I gained hands-on experience in financial audits, regulatory compliance, and due diligence, working on 10-K and 10-Q filings, internal controls, and risk assessments. Later, as a Consultant at PKF BBA, I helped businesses optimize financial reporting, strengthen internal controls, and streamline accounting processes to drive efficiency and accuracy.

Strategic Finance at Pulipati Associates
Now, as a Partner at Pulipati Associates, I work closely with businesses to build financial strategies that drive growth. My contributions include:

✅ Developing forecasting models and risk-mitigation strategies to help businesses scale.
✅ Implementing SAP FICO, NetSuite, and custom finance tools to improve reporting accuracy.
✅ Creating structured financial plans with measurable impact:

Increased family incomes by 35% through a strategic farming model.
Reduced emergency response costs by 40% for 50+ hospitals by implementing a financial planning framework.
Optimized capital management, improving liquidity and reducing financing costs.
Finance with Purpose
For me, finance is about driving business success, not just crunching numbers. Whether it’s helping a company scale, improving financial efficiency, or automating reporting, I thrive on turning financial challenges into growth opportunities.
