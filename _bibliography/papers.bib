  title={Fault Modelling of an Object-Oriented System using CPN},
  author={Kaushik, Shubham and Ratneshwer},
  abstract={Object-oriented development is a mechanism in which objects provide services to other objects by various means like inheritance, polymorphism, etc. Faults, in object-oriented software, may occur at two levels i.e. object level and interaction level (when one object provides/receives some services from others). A formal representation, of an object-oriented system, may be helpful to understand the behavior of software faults. Faults identification, at earlier stages, may help during the development and testing stages. In this paper, an attempt has been made to model several faults, in an object-oriented system, with the help of Colored Petri Nets. First, a formal representation of object-oriented properties is depicted by Colored Petri Nets. Secondly, various possible faults are modeled using different programming scenarios. The main emphasis was on faults that may arise due to objects and their interactions i.e. inheritance and polymorphism state. Such information may be useful during the testing and maintenance phases of software development.},
