# Strait of Hormuz, Israel-Iran Conflict & Market Risk

## Background

Recent reports indicate that Israel has launched strikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities and scientists. While the IAEA confirms no nuclear radiation spikes, the action raises serious concerns over geopolitical escalation.

One key question looms: **How will Iran respond?**

## The Strait of Hormuz: A Critical Chokepoint

The Strait of Hormuz is only 21 miles wide but is one of the most important shipping lanes globally:

- **30% of global seaborne crude oil**
- **20% of LNG exports**

Iran has previously threatened to close this waterway during periods of tension:
- **1980, 1990, 2007–08, 2012, 2017, 2018**

Even rumors of a closure can move oil prices dramatically. Some estimates suggest oil could surge to **$150/barrel** if shipping through the Strait is interrupted.

## Sector-Level Impacts

### Potential Gainers
- Oil Exploration & Production
- Oilfield Services & Equipment
- Energy-focused ETFs

### Potential Losers
- Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs)
- Airlines & Aviation Cargo
- Auto Ancillaries & Tire Manufacturers
- Emerging Markets dependent on oil imports

## Investment View

In a world where geopolitical risk is underpriced and markets are algorithmically reactive, even an isolated event can ripple globally.

My current strategy includes:
- Booking profits from overextended sectors
- Holding ~20% in cash for tactical opportunities
- Monitoring oil and defense-linked equities
- Watching shipping routes and maritime insurance costs

## Final Thoughts

I believe that war benefits no one—and though risk is rising, so is global interdependence. I hope diplomacy prevails. That said, being prepared—strategically and psychologically—is crucial.
